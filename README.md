# CNN-Pet-Classificaton
Convolutional Neural Network that utilizes the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset to classify images of pets (cats and dogs). This is a solo project that aims to utilize what I learned from my previous repo about starter neural networks. The main goal here is to attempt to build a CNN without any tutorials and to only aquire help for immediate problems.
